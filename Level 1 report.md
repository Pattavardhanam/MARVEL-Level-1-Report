# MECHANICAL

## Introductory Module
I made myself familiar with the basic definitions of CAD, CAED, etc., with the help of the file given in he resources of the MARVEL coursework page. I then applied for the educational lisence and began this wonderful journey of Design and Prototyping

## TASK: 2D Drawing sheet

## TASK: 3D Drawing in Fusion 360
I understood the basic drawing environment of Fusion 360, experimented with a couple of drawings as part of YouTube Tutorials and made the drawings required as part of the assigned coursework. The drawings are as shown below

### Solid Modelling
Designing a simple aerpfoil using Fusion 360. The NACA airfoils are airfoil shapes for aircraft wings developed by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The shape of the NACA airfoils is described using a series of digits following the word "NACA". The parameters in the numerical code can be entered into equations to precisely generate the cross-section of the airfoil and calculate its properties.

I used DAT Extenstion and using the coordinates of NACA 2412 designed an aerofoil for Horizontal Take Off and Landing Aircrafts(HTOL)

### Surface Modelling
Toroidal propellers, boasting a donut-shaped design with closed looped blades, are revolutionizing drone and boat propulsion. Unlike traditional propellers, their enclosed form disrupts airflow, minimizing the creation of noisy tip vortices. These vortices, swirling air masses at the blade tips, are the main culprits behind propeller whine. By distributing and dampening the vortices, toroidal propellers offer a quieter operation without sacrificing thrust, making them ideal for noise-sensitive environments.
This task was by far the most difficult and understading forms took a while. Encountered a few setbacks while designing the propeller
