# MECHANICAL

## Introductory Module
I made myself familiar with the basic definitions of CAD, CAED, etc., with the help of the file given in the resources of the MARVEL coursework page. I then applied for the AutoDesk educational lisence and began this wonderful journey of Design and Prototyping Level 1!
## TASK: 2D Sheet Drawing
Drafting on a giant A2 sheet with a tiny, precise mini drafter. Straight lines, perfect circles, and sharp angles emerge, transforming the blank space into a detailed drawing.
### Orthographic Drawing
Using the mini drafter, scale, drawing pencils I drew 7 Orthographic figures from the given drive folder.
The following the drive folder contains the drawings I made.

The 2D sheet drawings were a part of my 1st semester syllabus as well. It was a good practice for my exams!
## TASK: 2D Drawing in Fusion 360
Fusion 360 bypasses the drafting table, letting you create precise 2D drawings from 3D models.This digital workflow bridges the gap between 3D creation and professional 2D documentation.
I understood the basic drawing environment of Fusion 360, experimented with a couple of drawings as part of YouTube Tutorials and made the drawings required as part of the assigned coursework. The drawings are as shown below

## TASK: 2D Drafting
The Sierpinski triangle, a mesmerizing fractal, is formed by endlessly removing smaller equilateral triangles from a larger one. Imagine starting with a whole triangle, scooping out its center, and repeating this for each remaining triangle. This infinitely detailed process results in a ghostly silhouette with a surprising property: its area shrinks to zero, while its perimeter becomes infinitely long.
I manually found midpoints of the equilateral triangle and drew the Level 2 Sierpenski Triangle.

## 3D Drafting
### Task 1:
The Allen key, a simple yet mighty tool, tackles jobs with its L-shaped steel form. Its hexagonal end fits snugly into matching screw sockets, providing leverage for turning. Often sold in sets with various sizes, these unsung heroes tighten furniture, adjust bikes, and conquer countless everyday tasks.
I drew a 3D draft of an allen key by referring to online sources. I used a little bit of free hand sketching in this task

### Task 2:
I drew 3D machines using the skills I learnt from the 2D drawings in Fusion 360 and used the extrude tool.

## 3D Modelling:
### Solid Modelling
Designing a simple aerofoil using Fusion 360. The NACA airfoils are airfoil shapes for aircraft wings developed by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The shape of the NACA airfoils is described using a series of digits following the word "NACA". The parameters in the numerical code can be entered into equations to precisely generate the cross-section of the airfoil and calculate its properties.

NACA has 4 types of nomenclatures. 4-digit, 5-digit, 6-digit and 8-digit series. The most common (and the one I made) is 4-digit. Commercial airliners use 5 digit, the 6-digit series is for airfoils designed for high-speed applications. The 8-digit series is for "supercritical airfoils" aimed at maximizing laminar flow at supersonic speeds. 

I used DAT Extenstion and using the coordinates of NACA 2412 designed an aerofoil for Horizontal Take Off and Landing Aircrafts(HTOL)

### Surface Modelling
Toroidal propellers, boasting a donut-shaped design with closed looped blades, are revolutionizing drone and boat propulsion. Unlike traditional propellers, their enclosed form disrupts airflow, minimizing the creation of noisy tip vortices. These vortices, swirling air masses at the blade tips, are the main culprits behind propeller whine. By distributing and dampening the vortices, toroidal propellers offer a quieter operation without sacrificing thrust, making them ideal for noise-sensitive environments.
This task was by far the most difficult and understading forms took a while. Encountered a few setbacks while designing the propeller

### Sheet Metal
Fusion 360's Sheet Metal tools allow you to design objects specifically for manufacturing from sheet metal. You start with a flat sketch defining the part's outline, then bend and manipulate that form using tools like Flanges. The software considers factors like bend radius and material thickness to ensure your design can be realistically created.  This lets you create a 3D model while also getting a flat pattern for fabrication, streamlining the sheet metal design process.

### Organic Design using Forms
Fusion 360's forms act like digital clay for sculpting organic shapes. Forget rigid lines - create fluid curves with T-splines. Push, pull, and refine surfaces to achieve complex forms. Unlike solids, forms embrace overlaps, letting you explore freely before refining your design into a masterpiece.

## 3D printing
From digital dream to tangible reality, 3D printing brings ideas to life. Layer by layer, molten plastic or powdered metal builds intricate objects. Complex designs become reality, defying limitations of traditional manufacturing. 3D printing empowers creators, engineers, and dreamers to hold the future in their hands.
I learnt about 3D printing by reading the given resource article and a few blogs on the internet.

# ELECTRONICS
## Transistor Gates
Tiny transistors act as switches, building logic gates like AND and OR. In an AND gate, both inputs must be "on" (high voltage) for the output to turn on. Imagine two switches controlling a light - both need to be flipped for it to shine. OR gates are less strict - just one "on" input triggers the output. Think of two buttons turning on a light - only one press needed. These basic gates form the building blocks of complex digital circuits.
Learnt about Transistor AND and OR gates and first drew the basic sketch:
![AND OR](https://github.com/Pattavardhanam/MARVEL-Level-1-Report/blob/main/Pics/AND%20OR.png?raw=true)
Then I used tinkercad to simulate the design.

## N-Channel MOSFET
N-channel MOSFETs are tiny switches controlled by voltage, not touch. Electrons flow when a positive voltage opens a channel between the drain and source. Imagine a water channel controlled by an electric field. Perfect for low-power circuits, N-channel MOSFETs are workhorses in electronics, from phones to computers.
Learnt about the working of the N-Channel MOSFET from the resource link provided and made a basic design on TinkerCAD.

## Logic design:
I had learnt binary addition using 1's compliment and 2's compliment in 2nd PU. I learnt how full adders and 2x1 MUXs work. Using XOR gate, NOT gate(To give XNOR values), AND gate and OR Gate I designed a full adder circuit.
This is the implementation of the same:

I then made a 4-bit binary additon circuit using 4 full adders using 2x1 MUX:
